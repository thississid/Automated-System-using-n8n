# Automated-System-using-n8n

An **open-source AI-powered customer support system** that utilizes a **local LLM** (via **Ollama**) combined with **LangChain FAISS** as an **in-memory vector store** to retrieve past support solutions. The system is built with **FastAPI** for the backend and uses **n8n** for workflow automation. The entire setup is **containerized using Docker Compose** for easy deployment and scalability.

---

## **🚀 Features**

- ✅ **Local LLM with Ollama** – Runs models like **Mistral locally**, eliminating API costs.
- ✅ **Knowledge Base** – Uses **LangChain FAISS** to store and retrieve past support queries and solutions.
- ✅ **FastAPI Backend** – Processes customer queries, searches the knowledge base, and generates AI-driven responses.
- ✅ **n8n Workflow Automation** – Automates query handling, response generation, and email/messaging notifications.
- ✅ **Dockerized Deployment** – Uses **Docker Compose** to seamlessly manage all services.

## **📂 Project Workflow**

1. **Customer Query Handling** – A user submits a query via **n8n Webhook**.
2. **Processing & Retrieval** – **FastAPI backend** searches the in-memory vector database (FAISS) for similar past queries.
3. **AI-Powered Response Generation** – **Ollama LLM** generates a response based on the query and retrieved solutions.
4. **Response Delivery** – The generated response is sent back to the user via **email, chat, or another preferred method** using n8n.
5. **Containerized System** – **Docker Compose** ensures that all components (Ollama, FastAPI, n8n) run efficiently and communicate seamlessly.
